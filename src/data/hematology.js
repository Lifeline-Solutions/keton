        "Genrui 3 part differential hematology analyzer uses Coulter's Principle and is able to differentiate between 3 types of WBC's, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In a 3 part hematology analyzer basophils and eosinophils cannot be differentiated and are grouped with a population of either neutrophils or monocytes.",

Equipped with high technical smart counting mode and RFID card closed system, KT-40 only needs 9μl sample, could provide better repeatability for low WBC/PLT value samples and realize the real closed system. Besides, wider linearity brings the more widely clinical application. It’s the best choice for small to medium labs.',
