        'Myr Spin Tissue Processor STP 120 has been developed to meet the requirements of every single laboratory. The state-of-the-art technology and the unsurpassed processing method of the STP 120 qualifies it as the most successful Spin Tissue Processors ever. More than 3.000 units installed around the world confirms its leading position.',

        'This movement can be optionally activated on the control panel and allows the basket to perform an up-down movement inside the vessel that combined with the rotational agitation fulfills a helicoidal movement that increases infiltration quality at a high degree of precision. At the end of this process, baskets start centrifuging.',
        'CENTRIFUGING',
        'This function is activated as soon as the infiltration time comes to an end. The basket rises above the reagent’s level but rests inside the vessel.',
